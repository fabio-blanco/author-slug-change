# Author Slug Change

Author Slug Change is a small and simple plugin that intends to secure a WordPress author account by obfuscating its real name pointing to a different slug.

The plugin is not invasive. It doesn't change the database URL's but, instead it changes the slug at runtime.

# How to install

Just copy all its files to the `wp-content/plugins` folder of your WordPress installation.

# How to use

Login in your wordpress admin and edit the profile of the user account you want to obfuscate. At the section *Edit Author Slug* just configure the slug name that you want to display publically and save.
